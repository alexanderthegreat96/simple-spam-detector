# Spam Detection Class

## Introduction

The Spam Detection Class provides functionality for analyzing incoming messages and detecting spam in various applications, such as chat systems, user-generated content platforms, and real-time monitoring systems.

## Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing Spam Messages in a Chat Application

In a chat application, you can use the Spam class to analyze incoming messages for spam before displaying them to users. This helps in maintaining a clean and spam-free chat environment.

### Example 2: Detecting Spam in User-generated Content

When users submit content on a website or application, such as comments on a blog post or reviews for a product, you can use the Spam class to automatically detect and filter out spammy submissions, ensuring high-quality user-generated content.

### Example 3: Monitoring Spam Activity in Real-time

By continuously analyzing incoming messages in real-time, the Spam class can help in monitoring spam activity and taking proactive measures to prevent spam from spreading further. This is particularly useful in social media platforms and online communities where spam can proliferate rapidly.

## Parameters

- `messages`: Dictionary containing messages to be analyzed.
- `last_messages`: Number of last messages to consider for spam analysis.
- `message_interval`: Minimum time interval between consecutive messages.
- `spam_threshold_time`: Timeframe to consider similar messages as spam (in seconds).
- `similarity_score`: Similarity score threshold for considering messages as spam.
- `optional_spam_messages`: Optional list of predefined spam messages for comparison.

## Methods

- `analyze()`: Perform spam analysis on provided messages.

## Additional Usage Examples

### Customizing Spam Detection Parameters

You can adjust the parameters such as `last_messages`, `message_interval`, `spam_threshold_time`, and `similarity_score` based on your specific requirements and spam detection sensitivity.

### Integration with Real-time Systems

The Spam class can be seamlessly integrated into real-time systems to monitor and filter spam messages as they are received, ensuring immediate action against spam activity.

### Logging and Reporting

Implement logging and reporting mechanisms to keep track of detected spam messages and analyze spam trends over time. This can help in refining spam detection algorithms and improving overall system performance.



## Features

- Check for spam messages based on similarity to predefined spam messages.
- Check for spam messages based on similarity to the last few messages.
- Check for spam messages based on the frequency of message posting.
- Check for spam messages containing links.

## Usage
Instantiate the `Spam` class with the required parameters (This is a mock example):

```python
import time
import sys
from Spam import Spam

# Sample message cache
message_cache = {
    "messages": [
         {
            "message_id": 27634872634,
            "message": "Some message",
            "timestamp": time.time()
        },
        {
            "message_id": 27634872635,
            "message": "Another message",
            "timestamp": time.time()  
        },
    ]
}

# Initialize Spam object with the message cache
spam_checker = Spam(message_cache)

while True:
    # Input message from user
    message = input("Type your message here: ")
    
    if message.lower() == "exit":
        break
    
    timestamp = time.time()
    message_id = len(message_cache["messages"]) + 1  # Generate unique message ID
    new_message = {
        "message_id": message_id,
        "message": message,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
    message_cache["messages"].append(new_message)
    print("Message added to cache.")
    
    # Analyze the message for spam
    result = spam_checker.analyze()
    print(result)
    sys.stdout.flush()

print("Final message cache:")
print(message_cache)

```
